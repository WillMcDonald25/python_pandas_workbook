# pandas-challenge
 In this workbook, I create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

I've analyzed the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


Instructions
I Used Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, to create a report that includes the following data. My report must includes a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

District Summary includes the following:

- Total number of unique schools

- Total students

- Total budget

- Average math score

- Average reading score

- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

The School Summary includes the following:

- School name

- School type

- Total students

- Total school budget

- Per student budget

- Average math score

- Average reading score

- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
